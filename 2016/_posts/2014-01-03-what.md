# What

The U.S. federal government hosts a multitide of different scientific datasets, mainly through executive branch agencies like the EPA, NASA, NOAA, the Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior. Recently, many in the federal government at a variety of levels have communicated their antagonism toward the scientists, researchers, and civil servants who study and inform the public about a wide variety of topics. The federal government has already moved to expunge information related to climate change from [whitehouse.gov](whitehouse.gov) and introduced legislation to [abolish the EPA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861). We seek to protect vital public scientific and data resources from suppression by archiving them in multiple, redundant repositories so they may be accessed and reused after potentially disappearing.
